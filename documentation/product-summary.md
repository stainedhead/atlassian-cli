# Atlassian CLI - Product Summary

## Overview

The Atlassian CLI is a modern command-line interface that transforms JIRA and Confluence REST API complexity into intuitive developer workflows. Built with Go, it provides enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining simplicity for daily development tasks.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Developers waste time navigating web interfaces and remembering complex API parameters for routine JIRA and Confluence operations.

**Solution**: A CLI tool with smart defaults that eliminates repetitive configuration while providing full API access when needed.

**Result**: Streamlined workflows that integrate seamlessly with development processes, CI/CD pipelines, and automation scripts.

## Key Features

### Smart Default Configuration
- **One-time setup**: Configure default JIRA projects and Confluence spaces once
- **Hierarchical overrides**: Command flags > Environment variables > Config file > Prompts
- **Context awareness**: Automatically use appropriate defaults based on current project

### Secure Authentication
- **API token-based**: Industry-standard authentication with Atlassian Cloud
- **Memory-only storage**: No credentials persisted to disk for security
- **Multi-instance support**: Work with multiple Atlassian instances simultaneously

### Multi-Format Output
- **JSON**: Perfect for scripting and automation pipelines
- **Table**: Human-readable format for interactive use
- **YAML**: Configuration-friendly format for documentation

### Enterprise Features
- **Intelligent caching**: 5-minute TTL reduces API calls and improves performance
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for reliable operations
- **Audit logging**: Structured event tracking for compliance requirements

## Target Users
