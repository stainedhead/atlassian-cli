# Definition of Done (DoD) - Quality Software Development Rules

## Planning Phase
- [ ] **Requirements Analysis**: Product documentation (./documentation/product-overview.md) has been reviewed to understand context and features
- [ ] **Technical Planning**: ./readme.md and ./documentation/technical-details.md have been consulted for project structure and technical constraints
- [ ] **Test Planning**: Test cases have been identified and documented before implementation begins
- [ ] **Architecture Review**: Design follows modular, reusable patterns consistent with existing codebase

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements
- [ ] **Red Phase**: Failing unit tests have been written first to define expected behavior
- [ ] **Green Phase**: Minimum viable code has been implemented to make tests pass
- [ ] **Refactor Phase**: Code has been improved while maintaining test coverage
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage achieved for new functionality
- [ ] **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests implemented as appropriate
- [ ] **Test Automation**: All tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline

## Code Quality & Linting
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Code passes all configured linters (Go: golangci-lint, etc.)
- [ ] **Code Formatting**: Code follows consistent formatting standards (gofmt, etc.)
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Static security analysis tools have been run and issues resolved
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: All dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerability-free
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance-critical code includes benchmark tests

## Code Review Requirements
- [ ] **Peer Review**: At least one team member has reviewed and approved the code
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Code comments explain complex logic and business rules
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public interfaces are properly documented
- [ ] **Security Review**: Security implications have been evaluated by reviewer
- [ ] **Performance Review**: Performance impact has been assessed

## Implementation Standards
- [ ] **Modularity**: Code is organized into logical, reusable modules
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources (connections, files, etc.)
- [ ] **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe code where applicable

## Documentation Synchronization
- [ ] **Code-Documentation Sync**: ./readme.md, ./documentation/product-overview.md, and ./documentation/technical-details.md updated to reflect changes
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public APIs documented with examples
- [ ] **Changelog**: CHANGELOG.md updated with user-facing changes
- [ ] **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes include migration documentation

## Deployment Readiness
- [ ] **Build Success**: Code builds successfully without warnings
- [ ] **All Tests Pass**: Complete test suite passes in CI environment
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Integration with dependent services validated
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configurations externalized
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Appropriate logging and metrics collection implemented
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Deployment rollback procedure documented and tested

## Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Security Best Practices**: OWASP guidelines followed for applicable components
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets; proper secret management implemented
- [ ] **Access Control**: Appropriate authentication and authorization implemented
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Sensitive data properly encrypted and handled

## Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Performance requirements validated under expected load
- [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage optimized
- [ ] **Scalability Patterns**: Code designed to handle increased load
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching mechanisms implemented where beneficial

## Maintenance & Operations
- [ ] **Debugging Support**: Adequate logging and debugging information available
- [ ] **Operational Runbooks**: Deployment and operational procedures documented
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Application health monitoring endpoints implemented
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System handles failures gracefully

## Final Validation
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows tested successfully
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tested on target deployment platforms
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes properly versioned and communicated
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Performance meets or exceeds baseline requirements

**Note**: All checkboxes must be completed before code is considered ready for production deployment. Use this checklist during development planning, implementation, and pre-deployment validation.
